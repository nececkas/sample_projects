# sample_projects
These are some sample projects completed while earning a data analysis nanodegree from Udacity. I'm including here as a demonstration of my competence with the data analysis process and the programming languages Python and R.

All of the directories contain a readme file that can direct any interested viewer to the code files, the summary report, and the dataset.

Some of the people viewing this page might not be familiar with github or file directories, so I included one of the reports in the current folder: campaign_contributions_pa.pdf
