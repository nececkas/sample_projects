This statistical analysis was done as part of the data analyst nanodegree from Udacity.  Iâ€™ve uploaded it to github as a sample project for anyone who wants a demonstration of my competence with statistal analysis and the statistical tools available through Python.  

The jupyter notebook and html document are well-formatted. The spacing in the pdf is slightly wonky, but some people might find it easier to open a pdf.


Files:

stroop_effect.ipynb   -   A jupyter notebook containing the statistical analysis of the dataset.

stroop_effect.html   -   A html that presents the statistical analysis in a more viewer-friendly format.

stroop_effect.pdf   -   A pdf for any viewer that finds it easier to view this type of document.  Not as well-formatted as the html document.

stroop_data.csv   -   A dataset provided by the Udacity course for this analysis.
