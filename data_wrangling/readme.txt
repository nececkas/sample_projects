This data wrangling was done as part of the data analyst nanodegree from Udacity.  Iâ€™ve uploaded it to github as a sample project for anyone who wants a demonstration of my competence with data wrangling and cleaning using Python and data-base querying using SQL.  

The project worked with open street map data in Vermont, which is a collection of detailed data on the roads and buildings in Vermont.


Files in order of use during auditing/cleaning/processing OpenStreetMap data.
