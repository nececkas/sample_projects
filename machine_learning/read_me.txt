This machine learning project was done as part of the data analyst nanodegree from Udacity.  I’ve uploaded it to github as a sample project for anyone who wants a demonstration of my competence with machine learning and specifically with Python’s scikit-learn library.

The project analyzes the possibility to use machine learning to identify persons of interest with regards to fraud at Enron.
