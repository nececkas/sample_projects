This data analysis was done as part of the data analyst nanodegree from Udacity.  I’ve uploaded it to github as a sample project for anyone who wants a demonstration of my competence with data analysis and the data tools available through Python.  

The jupyter notebook and html document are well-formatted. The spacing in the pdf is slightly wonky, but some people might find it easier to open a pdf.

This was an early project and so the data analysis is much simpler than in some other projects.  A more throrough analysis is available in the data exploration directory here on github.

Files:

stroop_effect.html   -   A html document that presents the data analysis in a more viewer-friendly format.

brazil_medical_appts.ipynb   -   A jupyter notebook containing the data analysis and working code.  All code is written in Python.

brazil_medical_appts.pdf   -   A pdf for any viewer that finds it easier to view this type of document.  It includes the code, and isn’t as well-formatted as the html document.

The dataset is not included with these files, but can be downloaded from Kaggle:
